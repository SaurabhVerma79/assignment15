    "A database is a software system that is designed to store, manage,\n",
    "and retrieve data. It is a structured way of organizing and accessing data \n",

    "as managing business transactions, storing customer information, or managing \n",
    "scientific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational).\n",
    "The main differences between the two are in how they store and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model of data, which means that data \n",
    "is organized into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases use a language \n",
    "called Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the data. SQL databases \n",
    "are known for their ability to handle complex queries and for their strong data \n",
    "consistency and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed for handling large volumes of \n",
    "unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases do not use tables, \n",
    "but instead use data structures such as key-value stores, document stores, \n",
    "or graph databases. NoSQL databases are typically more flexible and scalable \n",
    "than SQL databases, but they may sacrifice some consistency and reliability for \n",
    "performance and scalability.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following are examples of DDL statements and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as \n",
